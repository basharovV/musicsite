I have recently worked on a fun short film called Into the Loo, which turned out to be a very colourful and exciting piece of short filmmaking. I found the directors Ka Sin Lee and Tin Ue Siu and got involved in the project by being active on the Vimeo forums, and quickly began to build the connection and understand the challenge at hand. The film tells a story by playing with speed, colour and rhythm in the visuals. The challenge of writing a score for such a film was making it weird and whacky while also matching the regular transitions, split-frames and other techniques. Additionally, all of this maintaining the essence of the underlying story and character development. Despite the 12 minute run-time, this short is back to back with music.

This is Alex, the protagonist:

He is a rollercoaster of frustrating emotions...and we see this face he makes a number of times throughout the film. We can see he's in an state of pure dissatisfaction, but it is also kind of amusing. The film is based around the transition of this character, and therefore the score had to be as well.

Here is a teaser trailer for the short film, which quickly flashes through various points in the film and showcases the cinematography and style.

##### Early stages of the score

I like starting with a clean slate, and not basing myself on presets or reference tracks too much. The directors did provide a sample score which was helpful to get a rough understanding of the musical direction. I loaded up a blank Ableton project and played along to the film. Piano being my main instrument, I warmed up by improvising possible melodies, progressions, and recorded the whole improv session. Through this session I realised what works and what doesn't for a particular scene. Eventually I had a few ideas that I could work with, both musically and as sound design for the tracks. I sent these to the directors and we began to work from there.

Here are some snippets of audio which I have made as quick, rough examples of possible musical themes - not necessarily tied to a specific scene, but mostly to get a feel for what I saw in the film in my first few attempts.

It was important to define the contrast between two sides of the protagonist, and two parts of the film which show the transition from an irregular, abstract and frustrating theme towards a rhythmic and upbeat score. The quick cuts, playback speed and split screens were supposed to be guided by the music to create a sense of audio-visual tempo and rhythm. Originally I wanted to explore changes in tempo, especially sudden jumps that could have quite an interesting effect on the pacing of the film. Here is something from the second version of the score, which has a crunchy guitar, punchy drums and plucky strings:

##### Final version

The score went through 4 iterations before reaching it's final version that we were happy with. The end result is something that's quite abstract, almost videogame-like but with it's raw elements of sound design and acoustic instruments and percussion. The contrast between the two sides of the main character are expressed more clearly in the score, taking the viewer on a journey rather than jumping between random unconnected points.

The final score is now available on my Soundcloud - click [here](https://soundcloud.com/vbash/sets/into-the-loo-short-film-soundtrack) to listen.

Some worthy of mention plugins and instruments that I used throughout the composition of this score:
- UVI Workstation VST: great for some retro sounding synths and bass patches.
- 4Front R-Piano by George Yohng / 4Front Technologies. This is a nice vintage sounding piano with slight overdrive.
- Ableton Operator. All-purpose synth built into Ableton - I used it thoroughly in this score.
- SA Jazz Drums - highly recommended jazz drum sample library. It's free and of surprisingly clean quality, with great sounding fills, hits and grooves.
- Kontakt / Sampler. Many sounds in the score were recorded by me or fetched from online sources such as [freesound.org](http://freesound.org).
