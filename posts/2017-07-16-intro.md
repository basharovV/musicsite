I launched this site a month ago as a way to share my music, and showcase my portfolio as a composer. As I add more content I also wanted to make things interesting and start this musical blog. ðŸŽµ

The purpose of this blog is to write about my journey as a composer and musician, the projects that I am working on and other musical adventures! In the recent months my fascination with film music and the world of cinematic scoring became an important part of my life. Through _limited_ personal experience, the insight of great modern composers and the magic of the Internet I'm gradually discovering the ins and outs of composing for the film industry, both in terms of the creative and professional elements. There's a lot to talk about, from instruments and genres to software, inspiration and workflow, and the challenges of scoring films as a freelancer/hobbyist.

I'm currently putting together a portfolio, a must-have for showcasing music, past projects and demos/rescores. This includes selected tracks which you will find on [**this section**](/tracks) of this website, as well as videos for a show-reel/demo type thing. Although I'm still discovering my own sound and style, my way of composing has it's roots in classical piano and jazz improvisation, with **a lot** of experimentalism and electronics too. I listen to everything and write anything - or at least I hope to...

Alright, let's do some scoring!

##### P.S I also developed this site from scratch using React JS - might write something somewhere about how I went about it too.`
