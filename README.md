This project is a responsive single-page-application (SPA) made with React. The purpose of the website is to be a musical portfolio for a composer/musician, as well as a blog with full Markdown support. Audio files and their information is served to the app via JSON, where the tracks can be played in a custom player component and filtered by tags or genres.

The project was developed using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), webpack, Babel and Express.
